## First Sprint

- **Forecasted Sprint Story Points [Rubric Criteria 1]:** 20
- **Rational for Story Points Forecast [Rubric Criteria 2]:**  We initially decided to attempt 20 story points in the first sprint.  This number is based solely on our individual experiences with past projects like this one.  We have no history of working together as a team and thus cannot draw heavily on "yesterday's weather" to refine our forecast.  Plus, 20 is a nice round number. :)
- **Refining the User Stories[Rubric Criteria 4]:** We reviewed and decided to split our 13 point "Manage Rules" User Story into two stores.  One story for the UI (at 8 points) and one story for the API (at 8 points).  Our two stores have been decomposed into tasks.  The stories with their tasks can be view at  https://github.com/MoneyWise2020/MoneyWise2020/issues/3 and https://github.com/MoneyWise2020/MoneyWise2020/issues/25
- **Creating the Sprint Backlog [Rubric Criteria 3]:** We pulled the above two stories (totaling 16 points) into our sprint backlog durning our Sprint Planning meeting.  All team members participated in Sprint Planning since we are all developers on the project.  The meeting was recorded and can be accessed here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YBYvbtzQM9F6hqz737ofrRtsPcP2D6QY708qJeZ_BDg/edit
